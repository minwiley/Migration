Project Final: Refugee Employment Success in the United States, a machine learning model. Success is subjective. We will measure success in this instance by Employment. We will attempt to predict and measure job employment success in refugees seeking asylum in the United States over a period of time (TBD). <br>

Can we predict success of a refugee? When success is measured by employment? <br>

We will attempt to solve, analyze, and visualize refugee employment success in the United States over a period of time. This project will use machine learning technology, most likely Sci-Kit Learn. Additionally, we may use Python Pandas, Python Tweepy, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, Javascript D3.js, MySQL Database, and Tableau to analyze and visualize this topic. We will work with high level datasets and mock data to simulate how machine learning is used; and create an analysis of this data to make a prediction and/or a regression. <br>

Initial research shows the data is not quite there for this proposal. Our team will utilize mock data. High level datasets from the census, uhhrc will be utilized to mold the mock data.<br>

Need to determine size of the mock data set. <br>

All: find data: origin country, asylum state or country, employment, language, skills, age, gender<br>
All: data cleaning<br>
All: analysis<br>

Yanjun: sentiment analysis at state or county level with tweepy. For or against?, visualization, ml<br>
Patricia: machine learning model, visualization<br>
Melinda: html, bubble chart visualization, ml<br>
Caylon: mapping visualization, ml<br>
Sean: mapping visualization, ml<br><br>

De-Mystifying ML
Find a Problem worth Solving, Analyzing, or Visualizing
Use ML in the context of technologies learned
You must use:
* Sci-Kit Learn and/or another machine learning library
You must use at least two of the below
* Python Pandas
* Python Matplotlib
* Python Tweepy
* Python Flask
* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
* JavaScript Plotly
* Javascript D3.js
* JavaScript Leaflet
* MySQL Database
* MongoDB Database
* Google Cloud SQL
* Amazon AWS
* Tableau

<br>

Prepare a 15 minute “data deep dive” or “infrastructure walkthrough” that shows machine learning the context of what we’ve already learned.<br>

Example Projects:<br>
Create a Front-End Interface that Maps to an API to “Smarten” the Algorithm<br>
Perform a Deep Dive of Existing Data Using Machine Learning <br>
Create a Visualization that Continues to “Learn” Where Clusters Lie Based on ML (Use D3 or Plotly to Change the Visualization)<br>
Create an idea with “mock data” that simulates how machine learning might be used<br>
Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression<br>
The key is to show the value of what you know.<br>
