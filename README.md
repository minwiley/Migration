De-Mystifying ML

Find a Problem worth Solving, Analyzing, or Visualizing

Use ML in the context of technologies learned

You must use:

* Sci-Kit Learn and/or another machine learning library

You must use at least two of the below

* Python Pandas
* Python Matplotlib
* Python Tweepy
* Python Flask
* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
* JavaScript Plotly
* Javascript D3.js
* JavaScript Leaflet
* MySQL Database
* MongoDB Database
* Google Cloud SQL
* Amazon AWS
* Tableau

De-Mystifying ML

Prepare a 15 minute “data deep dive” or “infrastructure walkthrough” that shows machine learning the context of what we’ve already learned.

Example Projects:

Create a Front-End Interface that Maps to an API to “Smarten” the Algorithm

Perform a Deep Dive of Existing Data Using Machine Learning 

Create a Visualization that Continues to “Learn” Where Clusters Lie Based on ML (Use D3 or Plotly to Change the Visualization)

Create an idea with “mock data” that simulates how machine learning might be used

Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression

The key is to show the value of what you know.
